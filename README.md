# 🚀 Computer Vision Training – Torpedo  

This repository contains solutions for a series of **computer vision tasks** as part of the Torpedo training program. The tasks involve **image and video processing**, including cropping, shape detection, color extraction, contour detection, and filtering techniques. All tasks are implemented in **Python using OpenCV**.  

---

## 🖼️ Task 1: Image Manipulation
- **Part A:** ✂️ Crop and save selected regions from an image. Demonstrates basic image selection and saving.  
- **Part B:** 🔵⬛ Draw shapes on images. Rectangle and Circle were chosen to demonstrate shape drawing and overlaying.

## 🎥 Task 2: Video Processing
- **Part A:** 🟠 Detect and extract regions with the color **orange** in a video. Uses color filtering and masking techniques.  
- **Part B:** 🖌️ Apply various filtering techniques to the video frames, including **edge detection** and other filters, to highlight and analyze features.

## 🧩 Task 3: Object & Shape Detection
- **Part A:** 👁️ Detect eyes in a face image and count the number of **Ballon d’Or trophies** in Ronaldo’s image. Uses object detection techniques.  
- **Part B:** 🃏 Detect contours of cards only (ignoring inner shapes), show each card masked individually on the original image, and filter out small/bad contours. Demonstrates contour extraction and masking.  
- **Part C:** 🔺⬛⚪ Detect and differentiate various shapes in images, label them accordingly, and save the results. Demonstrates shape recognition and classification.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- 🐍 **Python 3.x** – main programming language  
- 📸 **OpenCV** – image and video processing library  
- 🔢 **NumPy** – array manipulation and image masks

## 📝 Notes
- All images and videos used in the tasks are sourced from the provided **Torpedo training assets**.  
- Each task saves processed results in separate folders for easy review.  
- The project demonstrates fundamental **computer vision techniques** such as cropping, color detection, filtering, contour extraction, and shape recognition.
